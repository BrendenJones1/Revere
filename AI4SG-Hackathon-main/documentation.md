# Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Statement
- **Problem Statement**: There is a need to address the lack of accessibility to students who struggle with full comprehension of the English language. This is a significant issue as it affects the academic performance of students and their ability to succeed in their studies. The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of resources available to students who require additional support.
- **Objectives**: A product that can accurately record and transcribe spoken English into text and then translate it into the desired language and furthermore read it back outloud.
- **Target Audience**: Students who struggle with English comprehension, students with hearing impairments or other disabilities.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution
- **Solution Overview**: Our solution is to develop an AI-powered educational platform that provides accurate translations of English speech to other languages. This platform will utilize natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to convert spoken English into text and then translate it into the desired language. This solution will not only help students who struggle with English comprehension, but also students with hearing impairments or other disabilities.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Accurate translation of English speech to other languages.
  - Conversion of spoken English into text.
  - Translation into the desired language.
  - Text-to-speech functionality.
- **Expected Impact**: With this program, students who struggle with English comprehension will have access to a tool that can help them understand the language better. This will improve their academic performance and overall learning experience. Additionally, students with hearing impairments or other disabilities will benefit from the text-to-speech functionality, making educational content more accessible to them.

### 1.3 Technical Aspects
- **Programming Languages**: Python for backend development, HTML CSS and JavaScript for frontend development.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: openai, deep_translator, playsound, speech_recognition


## 2. Documentation of AI Tools Used

### 2.1 Overview of AI Tools
- **Tool Name**: ChatGPT and Claude
- **Purpose**: Front-end devlopment help and making the javascript work with the python backend.

- **Tool Name**: Github Copilot
- **Purpose**: Assist with completing the user's code by providing suggestions and autocompletion.

- **Tool Name**: openai
- **Purpose**: Provide the text-to-speech functionality to read out the translated text.


### 2.2 Application of AI Tools
- **When Applied**: Specify when each tool was applied during the project phases (e.g., brainstorming, developing).
- **How Applied**: Detail the methods or processes through which the AI tool was utilized.
- **Rationale**: Explain why each tool was selected for its specific application.

#### 2.2.1 ChatGPT and Claude
- **When Applied**: During the Ideation and Development phases.
- **How Applied**: Used ChatGPT and Claude to identify problems with out ideas for the project and to assist with the front-end development.
- **Rationale**: We used ChatGPT and Claude to help us brainstorm ideas for the project and to assist with the front-end development. These tools provided valuable insights and suggestions that helped us refine our ideas and improve the user experience of our platform.
  
#### 2.2.2 Github Copilot
- **When Applied**: During the Development phase.
- **How Applied**: Used Github Copilot to assist with code completion and increase the efficiency of the development process.
- **Rationale**: We used Github Copilot to help us complete the user's code by providing suggestions and autocompletion. This tool helped us write code faster and more accurately, saving us time and effort during the development process.
  
#### 2.2.3 openai
- **When Applied**: During the Execution phase.
- **How Applied**: Used openai to provide the text-to-speech functionality to read out the translated text.
- **Rationale**: We used openai to provide the text-to-speech functionality to read out the translated text. This feature enhances the user experience of our platform and makes educational content more accessible to students with hearing impairments or other disabilities.

### 2.3 Total use of AI Tools
- **Kithe-- 30%**: Used ChatGPT for ideation and assistance with back-end development.
- **Brendan-- 45%**: Used ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini for ideation and assistance with front-end development.
- **Marc-- 10%**: Momentarily used Github Copilot for some code completion.
