### PROBLEM STATEMENT
There is a need to address the lack of accessibility to students who struggle with full comprehension of the English language. This is a significant issue as it affects the academic performance of students and their ability to succeed in their studies. The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of resources available to students who require additional support.



### PROPOSED SOLUTION
Our solution is to develop an AI-powered educational platform that provides accurate translations of English speech to other languages. This platform will utilize natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to convert spoken English into text and then translate it into the desired language. This solution will not only help students who struggle with English comprehension, but also students with hearing impairments or other disabilities.
